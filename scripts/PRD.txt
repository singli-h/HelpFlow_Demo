<context> # Overview This product delivers a ready-to-deploy scaffold integrating Supabase, Clerk, and Stripe into a Next.js application to accelerate HelpFlow’s MVP development. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} Designed for HelpFlow’s engineering team, it provides a secure authentication flow, a payments pipeline, and database persistence out of the box, enabling focus on AI and n8n integrations. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} By leveraging existing official templates, the scaffold minimizes setup time and aligns with HelpFlow’s US business-hour remote-first environment, allowing demonstration-ready deployments on Vercel within four hours. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
Core Features
Clerk Authentication: Integrates Clerk’s prebuilt UI components for login, signup, and secure session management, ensuring multi-plan user onboarding in minutes.

<PRD> # Technical Architecture The system comprises a Next.js frontend, Clerk for auth, Supabase for Postgres and RLS, Stripe subscriptions via Checkout, and n8n workflows for AI calls. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} Data models include `users`, `subscriptions`, and `demo_requests` tables, each with foreign keys to link authentication and payment records. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12} APIs are primarily Server Actions in Next.js, invoking Supabase and Stripe SDKs; n8n is hit via a secure webhook to demonstrate OpenAI integration. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13} Infrastructure uses Vercel for frontend auto-deploys and environment management, with Supabase cloud and Stripe webhooks configured per project. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

Risks and Mitigations
Template Compatibility: Official repos may mismatch Next.js versions; mitigate by selecting actively maintained templates. 
GitHub

Auth/Data Sync: Misalignment of Clerk and Supabase IDs; mitigate via thorough RLS policies and end-to-end testing. 
Clerk

Stripe Webhook Latency: Delays in subscription confirmation; mitigate using retry logic and optimistic UI updates. 
Supabase

n8n Security: Exposing OpenAI keys; mitigate by deploying n8n behind an API gateway or use n8n.cloud.
